This is an interactive art project involving images being represented using blobs.. it should be interesting..

basically I'm playing with ideas from here: https://codepen.io/olleicua/pen/zdoQpz?editors=110
but with blobs representing the pixels of a low-res rendering of an image that the user has uploaded

at this point the user can upload an image which we can extract pixel data from. I the user to be able to upload a bunch of images and then select them from a gallery of thumbnails and watch a fixed number of black and colored blobs fly accros the screen to form the new image. At high res I hope to visualise a smooth transition from one image to another. Image one person's face reflected on a perfectly smooth pond and then a stone is dropped in and the ripples reform and distort the image to instantly be another person's face.
